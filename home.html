<h2>Renee Zhao's SIM Lab<span>RA, OSU Oct 2019 – May 2021 </span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Developed interface to communicate from computer to HIKIO 3544 device using C#. The interface helps the device record the electric resistance, output a excel sorted by recording time and automatically draws the resistance v.s time chart in the excel
<li>Built electromagnetic system for manipulating magnetic soft robots using Matlab that sends signals through the board to the 3-D coil, controlling the electric current and magnetic fields
<li>Participated in research of soft intelligent robots like Origami-based reconfigurable system using 3-D printer
</ul>
<h2>Zoomlion<span>AI Developer, Changsha May 2019 - July 2019</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Developed vehicle detection program using SSD and OpenCv with Linux system using Python. The program is used to help collect the plate and speed of vehicle when it’s entering the factory and count the amount of vehicles in each day. The program is widely used in the Big Data department to analyze information of different excavators in the factory.
<li>Deployed one object detection program using Tensorflow Lite on Android platform. The application is used to help the maintenance worker recognize different device component on large equipment and take advise from the Zoomlion central brain immediately. My part is to deploy the program from computer to mobile and try to accelerate GPU on mobile
<li>Seminar talk about the difference between object detection neural nets CNN, Faster-RCNN, YOLO
</ul>
<h2>Lijun Cheng's Lab<span>RA,  May 2022 - present</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Coworker for reviewing papers related to sgRNA, Croton_CRISPR like DeepHF. Compare the most efficient and effective method and test their LSTM networks.
